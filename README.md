### About tailMode
"TailMode" or "Firemode" is a mode that begins after you reach a certain score (default 15). When you reach that score, the snake's tail will begin to slowly "burn", until the entire snake is red. If the fire reach the snake's head, it's game over. To reset the fire, you need to reach the food before the time is up!
